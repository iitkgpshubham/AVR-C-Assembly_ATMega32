# ATMega32

This repository contains mini-projects on *ATMega32* microcontroller, as a part of course assignment in  **AT30001**(*Fundamentals of Embedded Control and Software*) and **AT60001**(*Embedded Control Systems*), taken as a part of micro-specialisation in *Embedded Control, Software, Modelling and Design* .

It contains 2 folders namely, 
1. Timers : This folder contains programs to test the capabilties of  the 3 timers 0(*8-bit*), 1(*16-bit*), 2(*8-bit*), through a problem statement. A brief report is also provided for findings.
2. Integer_Arithmetic : This folder contains programs for integer arithmetics signed/unsigned. Through a problem statement all operations are implemented. Higher bit arthimetic is also implemented using 8-bit instructions. A brief report is also provided findings.

Each folder contains implementations both in C and Asemmbly. The codes were simulated in *ATMEL Studio* .
